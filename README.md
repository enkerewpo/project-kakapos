## Development notification launchpad
This project is totally not official and so its codes maybe somehow messy.

### 2017.8.22
I just gave kakapos some simple auto-tab function and AStyle extension support.
The program is coming to be like a editor now... but now an inteligent IDE that it will be in the far furture.
Bugs to be fixed : terrible file directory split... and first time to write codes for C++ desktop program, the codes are terrible too...
