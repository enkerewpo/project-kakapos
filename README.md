__Kakapos__ is a next-generation open-source programming integrated development environment (IDE).

Project kakapos IDE is licensed under the GNU General Public License v3.0, And some part of the source codes may be used under the licenses of BSD, etc. This software is written in C++ with Qt5. 

## Build kakapos from source code
The source files are under the Qt project building method.
### Install Qt5
1. Download Qt5.9 from the [official website](https://www.qt.io/download/).
2. Install it with the Qt5.9 with __MinGW 5.3.0 Qt core__ just within the installer package to build this project.

## Development notification launchpad
This project is totally not official and so its codes maybe somehow messy.

### 2017.8.22
I just gave kakapos some simple auto-tab function and AStyle extension support.
The program is coming to be like a editor now... but now an inteligent IDE that it will be in the far furture.
Bugs to be fixed : terrible file directory split... and first time to write codes for C++ desktop program, the codes are terrible too...
