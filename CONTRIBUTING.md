# Contributing for kakapos
This project is totally open-source and everyone is welcomed to support it.
Currently, the easily way to contribute kakapos is clone a repo from GitHub and using your own Qt4+ to help to imrpove this.
Actually, this software is not going to be completed soon, because I'm still at Senior High and preparing for Olympaid for Infomatics.
If you want to help me build this amazing programming platform, I would really appreciate that and thanks a lot!
